# Text To Handwriting

Did you know that an average person‚Äôs handwriting speed is 13 words per minute, and their typing speed is 3 times greater?

I am an average person, and I‚Äôve found the experience of handwritten work to be awful if there is a lot of work to be done. Too much writing takes too long.

So I made this tool that converts text to an image that looks like handwriting.
